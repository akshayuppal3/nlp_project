../alldata/training/essays/1079196.txt,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.		Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"Personally, I agree with the statement saying that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. 
However, I do not think that this statement is completely correct. I have to admit that there are several companies advertising their products in an honest way, stating only facts about the product without any misleading slogans or jingles.
On the other hand, the majority of today\s industries is clever enough to trick their customers into buying their products. They do so by either creating highly convincing advertisemetns with slogans or jingles people tend to associate with the product, or they claim characteristics and facts about the products that are simply untrue. The most effective advertising strategy next to an easy to remember jingle you cannot get out of your head  is advertising with the support of celebrities presenting the product. 
Even though I do not like the idea of being lied to by a company, I can certainly understand this marketing mentality that is so widely spread today. In a world of globalization, open borders and free markets, every market of every country is flooded with an increadibly high number of foreign products. Not only do foreign products mostly seem more attractive to customers, they are often  cheap copies of orginals invented and produced in the home country.  Monoplies hardly ever exist anymore and competing not only with other companies in the country but especially with foreign companies certainly is rough. 
However, I think companies should only try to manipulate customers to a certain extent. There should be a clear difference between lying completely and persuading and influecing a little. Being a customer myself, of course, I rely on the government to control marketing strategies on the one hand but I definitely rely on own experiences I make on the other hand. If I know about a product that it does not fulfill all the expectations the company made me believe in, I will try my best to convince others not to buy it and I hope others will do so as well. And even if companies tend at times to overestimate a little and seem to be too euphemistic about their products, we still live in a world where people have gotten used to this kind of advertising behavior by now. I think, there is only a small percentage of society left that truly believes all the statements made in advertisement.

../alldata/training/essays/1109085.txt,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.		Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"People often argue about what is more important for students to learn: ideas and concepts; or facts. Based on my four years of experience as a teacher, I strongly believe that it is far more important for students to learn ideas and concepts. Facts change very quickly, whereas ideas and concepts remain useful for a lifetime.

One of the most important objectives of education is to prepare the students for their future careers. I believe that students who understand the ideas and concepts well have a much better chance to succeed in the future than those who simply learn facts. This is especially evident in disciplines like science and engineering, where there is very little that one can do by simply memorizing facts. A student who only learns the basic equations about electricity can not  solve problems that involve combining various concepts or ideas. It is far more important for the student to understand the fundamental concepts and ideas, and develop an ability to make use of these concepts to develop his or her own solutions to practical problems. Similary, in history, it is a lot more important to understand the context of a war, rather than learn the simple fact that the war took place in a certain year. For example, it would be a lot more useful to understand why and how Hitler came to power in Germany, rather than the dates of particular events. 

Another factor that illustrates  the relative importance of understanding ideas and concepts over learning facts is also evident from the rate at which facts are changing. The rapid developments in science and technology change the so-called facts at such a high speed that it does not make sense for a student to spend too much time on learning facts. As a teacher, I often notice that many text-books that I have begun to use for my classes only a few years ago have already become out of date! Ideas and concepts, on the other hand continue to be valid over much longer periods of time. Moreover, in many cases, it is even possible for the students to apply a concept they learned in one area to some other areas. Facts, on the other hand, can not be easily transferred from one area to another.","People often argue about what is more important for students to learn: ideas and concepts; or facts.

Compared with the decades ago, young people are required to study hard because they have to master more and more diverse skills including informaiton technology. In my observation, due to the time required to learn these skills, they do not have much enough time to contribute to their community.

For example,  a number of young people used the technology to support humanitalian projects in many communities. The young in Japan supported the people who lost their houses because of a massive eathquake by calling for the financial support on the Internet. Thus, they can and do use the technology to solve local problems.
     It would be tempting to argue that the young are not interested in their community considering their apathy in politics in some nations. However, the statement overstates the situation of such nations. When it comes to nations where political situations are not stable, the young are forced to participate in their communities. For instance, we do not have to look no further than Taiwan. Because of their severe condition in which the pressure from Beijing is massive, the young are serious about their future and their nation. Thus, the statement unfairly ignores such young people. 
     In sum, because of their difficulties, many young people do not have much time to helping their communities; however, the advent of the informaiton technology made it possible for them to participate in the community in new ways.

The need for certain risks, new expieriences and to be good at something is part of everyones way of life.

First, risks is often connected to the hormon adrenaline. If a person is in a dangerous situation his or her adrenaline level increases. This is often assiciated with a drug or the feeling to be alive. Successful people may have a greater need, because of their prior accomplishments, but this feeling and the hormon is common to every human being.

Second, the desire to try out new things and gain new expieriences is common to everyone. For examples, young children explore their surroundings and they find mostly great joy in it. This behaviour has obviously nothing to do with success.

Third, we live in a highly specialized world and nobody is able to be good at everything. Successful people, to my mind, have specialized in one trait to be successful. To learn another skill may lessen their ability to be good at their prime skill or at work. I study electrical engineering and i have to specialize to recieve an adequate education. Without the proper education I will not be able to find a job and because of this I will not be successful.

In conclusion, you can say that there may be a stronger appeal for successful people to experiment with new things, but the main ideas are merely human.

Changes in propellants, road conditions, and a growing population can disagree in single points of views, but mostly suggest an increase in the number of cars.

Scientists, governments, and car manufacturers are in the process of developing and improving engines using alternative propellants. These propellants include gas, hydrogen, or electricity, but are not limited to those. This development can cause a smaller dependency on oil. If this is true twenty years from now, people might have switched to those alternative propellants and do not see the necessity to get rid of a car in general.

This means that a student can do better if his basic knowledge of understanding is good. Learning facts is a part of study but one needs to deep knowledge to grasp facts and this comes by understanding ideas and concepts.

For example, a Biology student who is doing a research in the field of microrganisms can go ahead with his research only if he has the basic idea of microorganisms and their behaivour. By only learning facts, he cannot reach a final decision. To have his findings more a  solid basis, he needs to have a strong foothold in microorganic study.

Similar factors work with students who have just joined school or the ones who are in the process of a learning new subject. For instance, a mathematics student can do his high level arithmetic and algebra only if his lower level maths skills are developed. Furthermore, these skills become an inherent quality when he knows how to derive at a formula. Although learning a formula will make him work out easy problems but he will get stuck in the major issues.

In this sequence we can also come to a solution that understanding things is the key to success than merely knowing facts. A fact may help you out in the short run. It will not pave your path to reach your goal. A clear understanding develops interest in students to pursue their future in an innovative field of any branch instead of working on the set patterns by their ancestors.

Although learning a formula will make him work out easy problems but he will get stuck in the major issues.

In this sequence we can also come to a solution that understanding things is the key to success than merely knowing facts.

A fact may help you out in the short run.

It will not pave your path to reach your goal.

A clear understanding develops interest in students to pursue their future in an innovative field of any branch instead of working on the set patterns by their ancestors.

These criteria will also lead the world towards new technologies and sciences that are still undiscovered.

Considering all the above facts I completely disagree to the fact that it is important for the students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to lern facts."

another reason is that willbe more population in twenty years later than today.so as number of people grower,it will also grow number of car,people want.

Since the question states that not all advertisements, but most of them are making a product look much better than it really is, I am just going to give some examples in order to empiricly prove that the given statement is correct.
In that order my first example is the Mc Donalds french fries.
When you see their commercial on TV, where it is these tasty french fries just shouting out of that shimmering red box, they always look just fabulous. They are thick and have that perfect yellow-brownish color. And almost more important they lie in that box perfectly organized. Not a single one is misplaced.
Comparing that wounderful illusion of Mc Donalds french fries with the reallity one has to come to the conclusion that there is a gigantic diffrence between them. That example hereby strongly supports the given statement.
To give another example one just has to look at one of these energy drink advertisements. The advertisements tell you that by consuming that nice colored, always cooled looking drink all of your lost power or energy will be restored immediatly.

Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"The issue of traveling with a tour guide is a controversial one. Some people find it to be beneficial, and more informative while others think that traveling on their own is more challenging.
I , however believe that traveling with a group guide is better. The reasons for my belief are the following:

First, traveling with a tour guide is more informative, since the guide has all the information about the place, and should be able to answer any question. He has also visited the place many times, and knows all the interesting places to be seen. I think that a person traveling with a tour guide will gain much more inforamtion and knowledge about a country's culture, than if he was to travel by himself. I have travelled with a tour guide once to Turkey, and although it was a tiring trip because the schedule was full, I got to know most of the turkish culture. One of the things I won't forget, is when we visited a play about the old traditional turkish wedding. It was a very interesting thing to see.

Second, the tour guide usually has a schedule for his group. In this schedule the group gets to see the most important, famous, and interesting places in the country being visited, probably a person visiting the country on his own would not have been aware of, or could not have planned such a schedule.  I find the time schedule to be my ultimate reason to choose a tour guide. Another reason, is the financial reason, usually tour guides have special deals with hotels or resturants since they bring them customers.

Third, I believe that traveling with a tour guide who knows the country, and traveling with a group of people is much safer than traveling alone. When visiting a new place, a person does not know the safe places, or what time is a good time to walk in a certain neighborhood. These details, which are of great importance, are taken care of by the tour guide.

../alldata/training/essays/1728162.txt,Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?		Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.		Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"Swamped with commercials and advertisments in our daily lives, one might wonder whether a product's quality really correspond to the one being put forward by the ad or promotion. Although legally, companies can be held responsible for false advertisment, I believe that most of the sales and marketing campaigns for products do not reflect the real character of the product in question.

First of all, the praised outcomes of for instance cleaning products, can be questioned, as they deem to be very little effective for the actual purpose. Spot removal products are particularly known for this. Although  TV commercials highly recommend their use, real-life results tend to be rather frustrating. An ink spot or tomato sauce stain on your favorite yellow summer dress resists despite your desperate attempts of removing it with the highly suggested product. Unfortunately, one cannot blame the company, as the small print on the product usually allows for many loopholes regarding the interpretation of a product's effectiveness.

Furthermore, ad-campaigns, especially on TV or in the movie theatres, incite the viewers to step into a dreamland and do not reflect reality. By presenting a product, such as a Sports Utility Vehicule (SUV), as indestructable, indefeatable and magnificant, it may trigger hidden desires in potential customers. Yet, it is not important whether the product will be able to fulfill all the advertised qualities. In other words, the consumer, who will end up purchasing the item,  will most likely not need all the functions (e.g. four-wheeling) if the SUV is being used in an urban setting only. Nonetheless, it is important for the sake of the customer to maintain that dream alive.

Another argument, which supports my hypothesis is related to weight-watching products. It might be true that a person is able to lose a great amount of weight within the promoted time frame; however, this is rather a transient result. In fact, most of the time, customers who tried such products before, have found themselves with twice the weight they had before. Thus, the ad was only meant to effect short-term outcomes, rather than long-term related results.

In sum, the problem which advertisements are facing is a ""catch 22"". While they need to promote and even enhance the qualities and capacities of a product in order to incite consumers to buy it, they tend to exaggerate and paint an inaccurate picture of its real skills, which can lead to frustrating consumer experiences.","Swamped with commercials and advertisments in our daily lives, one might wonder whether a product's quality really correspond to the one being put forward by the ad or promotion.

I strongly agree with what the proverb says and furthermore I believe the same logic applies in this case, as well. The understanding of the ideas and concepts is just like the rod, whereas the facts are the fish that last only a day.
    I believe that an ideal education should equip students with the necessary techniques and concepts to tackle any problem as opposed to the specific solutions for the problems only covered in classes. This enables students to deal with a much wider array of problems as they learn a general recipe of problem solving compared to a case specific approach.
    One great example from contemporary education would be history classes. If facts were more important, then all a student would need to learn would be the years of certain events. However, I believe, and the statement asserts, that the motivations and consequences in a specific historic event should be studied more than the facts and dates. Rather than memorizing the year of a battle, an ideal history course should concentrate on the succession of the events that lead to the war. This, in turn, would enable students to reflect upon themselves and overcome similar challenges in their lives. Afterall life is a series of clashing interests, and it has been that way throughout history. Another proverb goes: ""History repeats itself"". It is true only if we value the facts more than the ideas behind the events.

Having studied maths, I believe I have a greater first hand experience with the latter example. The comprehension of concepts rather than pure learning of the facts is the mathematical philosophy.

Success not only means to be happy in terms of wealth, fame and appreciation, it also has a lot of bearing to self-satisfaction and the feeling of being at peace with oneself. 

Only if successful people cared about fame and money then I surely think that percentage of successful people living would have been far higher than it exists. The reason being there are defined and speculative ways for ganing wealth and fame or making pots of money. But for being successful in truest sense you have to be a risk taker.

This kind of reversal  and effective transition of the geography of tasks, work and assignments in to challenges and goals is what defines successful people from rest of the lot.

Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	",high,"I agree that twenty from now there will be fewer cars in use. The problems associated with traveling by car will far outweigh the advantages offered by it. This, I believe, will definitely make more people abandon cars and use other means of transport.
If we continue to use fuel at the same rate as we do today, we will definitely run out of fuel in twenty years. Since cars are entirely dependent on the non-renewable resources, there will be no fuel left for cars after twenty years. The littel amount of fuel that would be left would become so expensive that it would be beyond the reach of many. This would automatically mean a decrease in number of cars. 
Awareness about fuel shortage and resource conservation is rapidly increasing which I am sure would propel more people to opt for public transport systems instead of private vehicles. Car-pooling will also be considered as an option by many.
The pollution levels are at an all time high due to an enormous increase in the number of vehicles plying on the road. Such high pollution levels are already making goverments sit up and take appropriate measures to reduce the pollution. As part of reducing the pollution levels, the number of vehicles that will be allowed to ply on the road may also be restricted. 
The traffic snarls that one faces these days are so irritating that people will prefer to either use public means of transport or work from home. The advent of internet and other technologies has meant that now one can sit at home and perform all the business transactions.

Considering all the issues mentioned above, I truly believe that there will be fewer cars in twenty years from now.","I agree that twenty from now there will be fewer cars in use.

The problems associated with traveling by car will far outweigh the advantages offered by it.

This, I believe, will definitely make more people abandon cars and use other means of transport.

If we continue to use fuel at the same rate as we do today, we will definitely run out of fuel in twenty years.

Since cars are entirely dependent on the non-renewable resources, there will be no fuel left for cars after twenty years.

The littel amount of fuel that would be left would become so expensive that it would be beyond the reach of many.

This would automatically mean a decrease in number of cars.

Awareness about fuel shortage and resource conservation is rapidly increasing which I am sure would propel more people to opt for public transport systems instead of private vehicles.

Car-pooling will also be considered as an option by many.

The pollution levels are at an all time high due to an enormous increase in the number of vehicles plying on the road.

Such high pollution levels are already making goverments sit up and take appropriate measures to reduce the pollution.

As part of reducing the pollution levels, the number of vehicles that will be allowed to ply on the road may also be restricted.

The traffic snarls that one faces these days are so irritating that people will prefer to either use public means of transport or work from home.

The advent of internet and other technologies has meant that now one can sit at home and perform all the business transactions.

This mode of operation will be preferred over the conventional mode of operating through an office.

Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"I think understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students than simply learning facts.

In the following paragraph i will state my reasons why i do agree with the statement.
First of all I think in today's society and business it is important to communicate. Discussing and talking about problems and ideas in a classroom gives you the ability to talk to people more easily even if you are not the same opinion. You learn to understand their idea and why they might think this specific way.

If you have learned to understand the ideas and concepts of things you also learned to solve problems. If you didn't understand it at first, you looked for answers and ways that you might be able to understand it.
The third thing is that it is probably easier to learn for a test when you get the main idea or the whole concept. When you prepare for a test and just learn facts the whole time but don't know how they fit together or what their connection is, it is pointless. You might know it untill the next day but you will forget it in about a month. However, if you learned the whole concept and understood it, you are familiar with it and it is easier for you to recall things. I would like to support my statement with an example: In Math it is very easy to solve problems after you have understood the main idea and the concept of the solution. Some tasks might be harder but you always know at least the way to solve them. If someone would just learn the formulars but doesn't know how to use them or how to combine them he won't do good on any test.
Even so I support the statement I have to say that there are some majors where learning facts is partly necessary.

Big countries such as China or India have a huge demand for cars as their respective economies are growing and their inhabitants are becoming wealthier. Thus they will be able to afford buying cars. As cars are still perceived as symbols of power which represent a certain way of life, many individuals will acquire cars in order to demonstrate their new status. In addition, cars might contribute to the development of the large rural territories of those countries.

Moreover, cars will become even cheaper due to industrial and technological progress. Modern production plants provide much more efficacy than older ones did and require less ressources in order to produce cars. Thus, the average cost of cars will decline. Hence, it will be easier to sell cars even in underdeveloped regions.

Finally, many of the environmental problems that come along with the use of cars will be solved. There are already devices which effectively reduce the emissions of cars. Alternative sources of energy such as electricity or sustainable fuels will be found. That is, future cars will not have to rely on gas and oil. A lot of research is being done in this regard and has already yielded some encouraging results.

To sum it up,  there is a growing demand for cars. On the other hand, cars are becoming cheaper, and the environmental problems caused by cars will be reduced.

Use reasons and examples to support your answer.	",high,"I disagree with the statement. Lets guess what can be the possible reason or factors which can lead to fewer cars in future.

One reason may be that fossils fuels would be exhausted. Then there would be no way to run the cars, which may lead to decrease in their numbers. But scientists have estimated that there is enough fossil fuel for the next fifty years. So my guess is that cars number may go down but certainly not in the next twenty years.

One may argue the due to unforeseen reason the cost of fuel goes up. Even if that is the case, I hold to my claim that the number of cars running on the roads will not decrease. Because cost of everthing is related to the cost of petroleum fuel, directly or indirectly. On the whole the relative cost of the fuel will remain the same. There would be no reason to abandon your cars. 

Yes, there is a possibility that new transport vehicle comes into the picture in the coming years. But it would be expensive. All products in testing phase are expensive. The new products cannot reach to mass production stage in just twenty years. How many years do you think inventions like aeroplane, television, even the electric bulb took to come to a situation where they were mass produces. You have to build the entire architecture for that new product, which may take more time than the development of the product. Like to operate a  electric bulb  you need a fully functional electric network!

People are not going to dump their cars for a new product. This is especially true for the people in underdeveloped and developing people, where they don't throw away even non functional things! And these people constitute a majority when the whole world is considered. 

Also there is a reliability issue. The cars after serving decades are quite reliable. You have choices. There are motor cars. There are flashy royal cars like Mercedes. You have entire car sport based on them. People are not going to abondon them in such a short time. Though vehicles have replaced the use of animals like horses for transportation but there are still horse races. The number of horses has not come down. 

One may claim that people might become so serious about the pollution so they may stop using cars. They are not going to be serious unless it threatens their lives. And if the number of cars does not multiply beyond our imagination, there will not be a situation where car pollution would hurt us that much. The situation, I guess, will remain the pretty same.

It is possible that the world comes to an end. Or the whole world would be submerged in water. Thats a different issue. Assuming that life goes on as it is now and no such abnormal activity happens, I see no reason why the number of cars being used will come down.","I disagree with the statement.

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.	,high,"""Seize the day"" used to say the Epicurists, who else but young people would apply this moral point of view? Indeed I think that  young people do better know how to enjoy life than older people. There are several reasons for this belief.

      First of all I must acknowledege than the older people do, in one way, enjoy life for the simple reaon that their life is coming to its end. But, given that, I think that the young people live their life more intensively than their fathers or grand fathers do.
 
        Why do I say that? Because teenagers, and the young adults are eager to live their life, not only to live it in a normal way but to feel they are alive. They want to feel the life flowding in their veins. Thus they do crazy things thinking that they may be unable to do it afterwards. For instance young people are very fast drivers, very heavy drinkers, and very good at partying all night long. 

        Moereover, they don't only live more intensevely ""normal life"" but they are also looking for crazy things to do like jumping from an aircraft or jumping with an elastic from very high spots. I don't think that an eighty-years-old-grand mother would do that. Thus for two reasons. One is that she will be physically too old, an other one is that she will be mentally too old. At her age pleasures of life does not remain in risky things to do. She is just looking for some quiet stuff to make. But is she still enjoying life? She is certainly enjoying the end of it when young people are enjoying the dawn of it.

         That is the other main reason why young people are not only enjoying life but living it. It's because all opportunities are wide opened to them. A young mind is full of projects whereas an old one is full of memories. One is living things for real, an other is living them in fiction.


          All in all it appears that the young seize the day when the older look at it. But we can't deny them any pleasure for that. They are just saying ""carpe diem"" in a more peaceful way.","""Seize the day"" used to say the Epicurists, who else but young people would apply this moral point of view?

One is that she will be physically too old, an other one is that she will be mentally too old.

At her age pleasures of life does not remain in risky things to do.

She is just looking for some quiet stuff to make.

But is she still enjoying life?

She is certainly enjoying the end of it when young people are enjoying the dawn of it.

That is the other main reason why young people are not only enjoying life but living it.

It's because all opportunities are wide opened to them.

A young mind is full of projects whereas an old one is full of memories.

One is living things for real, an other is living them in fiction.

All in all it appears that the young seize the day when the older look at it.

But we can't deny them any pleasure for that.

They are just saying ""carpe diem"" in a more peaceful way."

Young people are now under the effects of corporate culture everywhere. Whether this be their schoo, home or office .  This demands them to be at their best everytime.

This is not just because of communication gap but as well they are not concerned about their state.  In most of the cases they are non existent for them. With such apathetic attitude towards their parents, spending time for their community can be easily ruled out. 

Idea to help and connect is dying. A perfect example of this could be of how we like to make new friend through internet but young people are hardly aware of sufferings of r next door neighbour.

Leaving community, young people find it difficult to communicate with their parents and family members.

This is not just because of communication gap but as well they are not concerned about their state.

In most of the cases they are non existent for them.

With such apathetic attitude towards their parents, spending time for their community can be easily ruled out.

Idea to help and connect is dying.

A perfect example of this could be of how we like to make new friend through internet but young people are hardly aware of sufferings of r next door neighbour.

Perhaps an example of apathy of young people towards their community can be best seen with recent Katrina hurricance in America.

There were hardly any initiative being taken by any young people.

Hence people do not give time to helping their communities."

On the one hand I think this statement will become true for several reasons.
First of all gas prices are rising constantly for the last few years and this trend seems to continue. Therefore many people will not be able to keep their cars or at least reduce the distances they dirve to a minimum. Instead they will try to find alternatives such as taking the train or the bus.

On the other hand there are also reasons that support the idea that in the future the number of cars will not decline.
Allthough there will be more alternatives in the future to travel comfortably, made possible by for example new inventions like the transrapid, these inventions are still to expensive for most of the people.

For example, Bill Gates, one of the most successful businessmen in the world, did not even graduate from the university. His great invention, Windows was nothing but a program with simple design at that time. His courage and plan, however, was not simple nor easy at all. As if he needed to prove that he is a talented businessman, he had to visit numerous numbers of people to pursuade them that his invention is amusing. 

Additionally, Bill Gates did not always succeed. His business went through several hard times. His business went through several trials because people were jealous of him all the time. Once, he had to leave the company for dominating the market. This is very absurd in my opinion because if running the business really well is a problematic, how come many people are trying so hard to become a successful business man? 

Gate's another great invention, XBOX, shows another example. At that time, the future of XBOX was very unclear. The market was already being dominated by SONY's Playstation II.

Bill Gates took the risk of selling ungaurenteed product to the market and thanks to his idea, XBOX almost dominated the market in the North America.

Who is more successful, a person who takes risks or a person who does not?

In my opinion, if you are successful in your job, in your career, in you social life is because you have been developing some skills and situations that you already control and you know that they work. In my personal experience, I am a general dental practitioner, or a normal dentist. I know how to do my work in order to obtain good results. I would never try something new or risky in order to be more brave if I do not know for sure it will end successfully.

Those  who take risks to ""try"" to find success is because they have nothing to loose. 

For instance, imagine I had a business and for any reason it just failed. I would loose all my investment and I would be in bankrupcy. I have lost eveything. In this case if someone told me that he/she had an exeptional opportunity for me to start a business from the very beginning I would take the risk becuase I have nothing to loose.

Let's see another example in my professional life. A patient comes into my surgery complaining of pain in the central incisor. I take an x-ray and has a very big infection in the root. I have never done an apiceptomy (open the gum and cut the root) and I would never try to do one without the appropiate training as it can be dangerous for the patient.

Twenty years from now there will be more and more people coming to cities and towns in search of jobs and other requirements and population is increasing day by day. So after few years many people would require cars for their personal use. 
Now the number of cars are less becuase becuase big car companies donot go into remote places and villages to sell the cars as many people dont buy them. In future they might go into remote places in order to increase their sales. This is not possible today for many car companies because they dont have many funds to do provide cars and market them in villages.
Now a days there is only one car per family because only one person works in a family in India. In the future both wife and husband may work and both require cars. Needs of people are growing, people who own a two wheeler today want to shift to a car tomorrow.
Population is increains so to meet the increasing demand of the people more cars are manufactured so that every person can own a car and not depend on others. 
Car companies are increasing their production day by day in order to get more profits and the company will prosper.  They are increasing their production seeing the increaing demand in the market. Demand is increasing in the market as better roads are laid, better infrastructure is devloped and policies are made such that cost of the car comes down and even common man can own a car. These all reasons suggest that more and more cars will be used by people in the future.
Many banks and financial companies are bringing out plans so that it is easy for a person to earn a car. This plan will increase the number of cars on road as it is no longer a burden to own a car.
Due to advancement in technology new cars are coming with more latest features which makes a person's desire to eard a car. Growth in technology and ways of manufacturing cars are bringing out many cars which are advancement to their previous models. Through all this means it will increase the number of cars in the near future.
Before car was used as just a transportation mediun. Now it  is not like that as owning a car is a passion and even desire to some people. There were only few features in cars before but now a days the features in cars are multiple, with this you along with driving can do other work like listening to music relaxing and even office paper work as cars donot shake or give disturbace while driving.
Improvement in technology is making car driving easy and ride more and more comfortable.

They are increasing their production seeing the increaing demand in the market.

Demand is increasing in the market as better roads are laid, better infrastructure is devloped and policies are made such that cost of the car comes down and even common man can own a car.

These all reasons suggest that more and more cars will be used by people in the future.

Many banks and financial companies are bringing out plans so that it is easy for a person to earn a car.

This plan will increase the number of cars on road as it is no longer a burden to own a car.

Due to advancement in technology new cars are coming with more latest features which makes a person's desire to eard a car.

Growth in technology and ways of manufacturing cars are bringing out many cars which are advancement to their previous models.

Through all this means it will increase the number of cars in the near future.

Before car was used as just a transportation mediun.

Now it  is not like that as owning a car is a passion and even desire to some people.

There were only few features in cars before but now a days the features in cars are multiple, with this you along with driving can do other work like listening to music relaxing and even office paper work as cars donot shake or give disturbace while driving.

Improvement in technology is making car driving easy and ride more and more comfortable.

So with all these reasons I dont think that number of cars after twenty years will come down but they will increase in number and increase in varities satisfying wide range of people using it."
